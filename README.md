This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app


## Step 4: Do yarn install to download latest depedencies 
```sh
# Using yarn 
yarn install 
```

USAGE

// Enabel screen shot in android
```sh
  const allow = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await NativeModules.PreventScreenshotModule.allow();
      Alert.alert(result);
      console.log("result>>>",result)
      setEnabled(true)
      console.log("activate>>>")
    } 
    
    catch (e:any) {
      setError(e);
      console.log(e);
    }
  }
```

// Function to detect screenshot

  ```sh
  const detectScreenshot = () => {
    if (ScreenshotModule) {
      const eventEmitter = new NativeEventEmitter(ScreenshotModule);
      eventEmitter.addListener("ScreenshotTaken", () => {
        setDeviceData((prev) => ({ ...prev, screenshotDetected: true }));
        sendDataToServer({ ...deviceData, screenshotDetected: true });
      });
    }
  };
```


// Disable screen shot in android
```sh
  const forbid = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await NativeModules.PreventScreenshotModule.forbid();
      Alert.alert(result);
      console.log("result>>>",result)
      setEnabled(false)
    } catch (e:any) {
      setError(e);
      console.log(e);
    }
  };
```
